# Unix
Unix is a fictional e-commerce website that sells magical objects seen in Disney movies.

Motivation: The goal was to create an online website for the first time in my Internet Computing course with a unique idea. 
I chose the idea of selling magical objects in order to build a creative and aesthetically pleasing website with my group.

Build Status: The Website is mainly finished, but if our group and I had more time, we would have:
- Finished more of our functional frontend details
- Added a "Contact Us" Page
- Created our website with more focus on perfecting the design

Customer’s Point of View:

Login/Register Page - This page allows the user to either create an account with us by registering an account 
(inputting fields for username, password, and email) or by logging in with an already existing account 
(inputting fields for username and password). After clicking the login or register button, the user will be redirected to the homepage.

Homepage - This page includes the header, the main section, and the footer. The header includes the links for the “Home” page, 
the “Products” page, the “Cart” page, and the “Login” page. The “Explore” button is linked to the “Products” page. 
There is a section under that which features a few of our products. When the products are clicked upon, 
the user is redirected to the product details page for the specific product. Below the featured products, 
there is a section that includes the “About Us” information as well as the FAQ with answers shown. 
The section after that includes reviews written by specific Disney characters to keep the fairytale idea in action. 
Lastly, the footer is shown.

Products Page - This page includes rows of different products that are shown in Disney movies. These products show an image of the product,
the name, the rating, and the cost of each item. The sorting selection is purely for website decoration purposes 
and so is the section at the bottom of the listed products that shows the number of pages there are present. 
These two options are nonfunctional. We also only created individual product pages for a select few products. 
These products include: Enchanted Rose, Magic Mirror, Genie’s Lamp, Hermione’s Bottomless Bag, and the Fountain of Youth. 
These products all have their individual pages when clicked upon. 

Individual Product Pages - These pages display the product image, the product name, the price, the quantity, the description, 
and the “Add To Cart” button, which, when clicked on, redirects the user to the “Cart” page.

Cart Page - This page displays a set amount of products. We have added 3 specific products, again, as decoration. 
We included the product image, the product name, the quantity, and the subtotal, tax, and total. 
The remove button is also displayed and is nonfunctional. When the user clicks the “Process Payment Info” button, 
the user is brought to the Shipping Address Page.

Shipping Address Page - This page has a form. This form includes the fields: First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code. 
At the bottom of the form, there are two buttons: “Go To Cart” and “Continue.” When the user clicks “Go To Cart,” 
they will be brought to the Cart page. When the user clicks “Continue,” they will be brought to the payment page.

Payment Page - This page includes a form for the user to input their payment information, 
which includes Card Number, Name on Card, Expiration Date, and CVV. 
At the bottom of the form, the user will see two buttons: “Go Back” and “Submit.” 
When the user clicks “Go Back,” they will be taken back to the Shipping Address Page. 
When the user clicks “Submit,” they will be taken to the Payment Confirmation Page.

Payment Confirmation Page - This page displays a message that says “Your order has been placed. Items will be sent out ASAP,” 
which lets the user know that their payment has been a success. 
There is also an “Exit to Homepage” button, which, when clicked on, will redirect the user to the Homepage. 


Admin’s Point of View:

Each function within the Admin’s Point of View can be accessed at the top of the header.

LogOut page-  This page is used to switch between the user point of view and different admin accounts. 
We’ve provided different admin accounts for each team member, as well as fictional user accounts that are functional to log in. 

Login/Register-This page is exactly the same as the customer login page.

Add Product- This page Admin can input product name, description, upload an image of the product, input price. 
Once that is done the admin is required to click the “Add Product” button. 
This will make the product on the Products page visible to the user and admin. 
The user can also add the product to their cart once the admin had added the product.

Update Customer - Provides the option to update customer information and delete a customer. 
Within this page, the admin can see the customer, email address, and a button to update or delete customer information. 
When updated the admin is redirected to the ‘Edit Customer” page. From there the admin can edit any account information. 

Update Admin- Like the Update Customer page, when the user wants to edit information from a specific admin 
they can click the edit button which will redirect them to the “Edit Admin” page.
